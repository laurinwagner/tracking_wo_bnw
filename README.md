# Tracking without bells and whistles extension

This repository provides an extension of the paper **Tracking without bells and whistles** (Philipp Bergmann, [Tim Meinhardt](https://dvl.in.tum.de/team/meinhardt/), [Laura Leal-Taixe](https://dvl.in.tum.de/team/lealtaixe/)) [https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.05625]. Instead of using bounding boxes to track objects, we (Laurin Wagner and Valentin Koch) do a full segmentation of each object. This was made possible by the MOTS dataset which provides pixelwise segmentations for some of the individual objects on four of the seven scenes of MOT17 Dataset. 

In addition to our [analysis](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1msNlHz0vjo9QW0cgqweB3-LtrvaMhVDx) of our approach and problems that arise when using MOTS dataset to improve the tracking on MOT17 Dataset, we also provide sample videos of the results.

## Python Notebooks

We provide two Google-Colab Notebooks: One which we used to train and evaluate a Mask-RCNN using the MOTS-Dataset, and one that evaluates the tracking performance of our Tracktor Add-On on the MOT17-Dataset. You can modify settings in the respective notebook. <br>

## Sample Videos

We provide 2 rendered videos of different scenes with different resolutions and frames per second. Both are using public detections. [Video 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U3GR-5guVGACaIpMq3un9kozIcrovPSa/view?usp=sharing)
